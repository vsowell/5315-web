      <h3><b>What is Docker</b> </h3>
      <p> Docker is an open source software that provides containers.</p>
      <p> These containers are like mini-storage systems that can run</p>
      <p> filesystems in an enclosed environment independent of other </p>
      <p> systems you may have installed on your own computer, </p>
      <p> virtual desktop, or other medium. </p>

      <h3><b>What is Nginx</b></h3>
      <p>Nginx is an open-source  webserver. Using HTTP, it processes requests.<br>
      It was created by Igor Sysoev and  is a direct competitor of Apache. <br>
      The main benefits of Nginx over Apache are the ability to multitask <br>
      and run multiple processes at once and run  different jobs during each process,<br>
      making it more efficient and requiring less memory to do so.
